# ticker

This will be a simple Python app that, when executed, will ask for a stock
symbol. It will then open search pages in several prespecified websites.


Sites:
zacks.com
finviz.com
openinsider.com
earningswhispers.com
shortsqueeze.com
insidercow.com  -- This one could be tricky. I can't build the search url.

To do this project I am going to need to learn a couple new things. I will need
to build a simple ui. I will use tkinter to do this. I will also need to learn
how to package this up into an executable. I plan to use pyinstaller for that.
